  <p class="hero-description">I specialize in aligning teams around a clear vision, scalable processes, and human-centered product outcomes. My work centers on helping organizations reduce friction, strengthen cross-functional collaboration, and empower teams of designers, product managers, and engineers to deliver consistent, high-quality product experiences at scale.</p>
  <p class="hero-description">When I'm not leading highly effective and productive teams I enjoy traveling, photography (see a few examples <a href="/photos" class="photo-link" id="photos-nav" data-link>here</a>), cooking (and eating!), writing, and board games. </p>

  <div class="">
    <h3 class="about-header"><span>+</span> Systemic enablement</h3>
    <p>My approach begins at the operational level. I build the conditions that allow design to thrive by establishing repeatable processes, design ops foundations, and cross-functional clarity. I help teams reduce operational friction, streamline workflows between design and development, and create environments where cross-functional product teams can move with confidence and alignment.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="">
    <h3 class="about-header"><span>+</span> Strategic clarity + vision</h3>
    <p>I bring strategic clarity to complex product spaces. Whether shaping product roadmaps, defining experience frameworks, or facilitating alignment across disciplines, I focus on connecting long-term organizational goals to day-to-day execution. My leadership style centers on transparency, communication, and empowering teams with a shared direction and purpose.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="">
    <h3 class="about-header"><span>+</span> Human + Machine harmony</h3>
    <p>With roots in both UX and technical domains, I bridge the gap between engineering logic and human experience. I help organizations create products where systems work cleanly behind the scenes and users feel supported, understood, and empowered. This balance is at the core of how I define product quality.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="">
    <h3 class="about-header"><span>+</span> Process optimization for quality</h3>
    <p>High-quality products emerge from high-quality processes. I focus on designing the connective tissue between teams, ensuring handoffs are seamless, decisions are thoughtful, and collaboration is natural. I help organizations set up processes that reduce rework, accelerate delivery, and consistently produce better outcomes.</p>
