    <h2>Graze Your Way to Lostness</h2>
    <p class="hero-sub">The Case for Long-Term Vision</p>
  </header>
  <div class="blog-text">
<p>An old farmer once said that cows don't get lost all at once. They graze their way to lostness. Their heads are down and they just search for that next patch of grass to munch on. When they do finally look up, they have no idea where they are or how they got there.
</p>
<p>In some ways, IBM is one of these cows, grazing our way to lostness. Driven by quarterly revenue goals and the pressure to "wow" at THINK each year, our goals are rarely about the long game. Short-term plans and nearsighted thinking sometimes work on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but over the years this approach causes us to be left behind. With our heads to the ground searching for that next clump of grass, we eventually look up and see the Amazons and Microsofts of the world innovating and disrupting, causing us to play catch up, rushing to the green pastures they've discovered.  After each of these frantic sprints, we arrive where others have already been, only to see that the true innovators crossing the next horizon. We are left in the dust with a poor version of what was once differentiating technology, but is now considered table stakes to forward thinkers. Our rush to catch up causes internal misalignment and leads to poor quality products. We overestimate what we can achieve in a quarter and underestimate what we can achieve in two, five, or even ten years. 
</p>
<p>This panic causes a culture of self-preservation. Divisions and orgs do not communicate, much less cooperate because they are chasing after their own goals and priorities. We create redundant products, undermine the goals of one another, and offer minimal functionality because we are not cooperating and sharing big ideas. Self-interest is not the best interest.  We need true unification across orgs to produce the best outcomes in the most efficient ways. 
</p>
<p>This requires foresight and vision that all are aiming toward and an organizational model to support it. In order to stop thinking with a short-term mindset and chasing after "quick-win", feature-centric goals, we need a unifying vision of what the future might be, a clear strategy to move in that direction, and the courage and time to execute properly.
</p>
<p>When I was a kid, my dad took me orienteering, a semi-competitive game where you try to find hidden markers in the woods using only a map and a compass. At first I would hold the map and compass the entire time, adjusting each step as we went, ensuring we didn't stray off course one bit, trying not to trip over rocks and roots. I didn't want to slow down out of fear we'd fall behind. That is until my dad taught me a trick to get ahead. We would align ourselves to the map and use the compass to point ourselves in the right direction. Then we would look up from the map in the direction we wanted to go. We would look to the horizon and find a landmark. Once we spotted a fallen oak or a dry gully, we'd put away the map and compass and run to that marker. 
</p>
<p>By slowing down enough to properly orient ourselves - setting our sights on a distant landmark rather than worrying about each step - we were able to move faster and more accurately toward our final destination. We didn't need to see the end, but we also didn't need to worry about each step. We set our eyes on the horizon and ran.
</p>
<p>New projects need to slow down in order to speed up. When we are playing catch up to the competition, we move fast but fast isn’t always the fastest. We need org charts and a clear vision and strategy for where each project is going. We need a communication plan, a documentation plan, and execution practices like Agile and 3-in-a-box to be clarified before kickoff.
</p>
<p>In addition to slowing down on a tactical level, we need to slow down and orient ourselves toward whatever future we can envision. This is the work of speculative design and futures thinking. We must be able to think more than one quarter into the future. We have to plan for more than one year ahead. If we cannot set our sights on what might be in five or ten years, how can we possibly call ourselves an innovative company?
</p>
<p>To organize ourselves for this long game, we need to think about two distinct roles within any innovative journey: the pioneers and the settlers.
</p>
<p>When Europeans first started exploring the "new world" there were two kinds of people: pioneers and settlers. The pioneers were the visionaries. They set out into the unknown to discover something new. This was dangerous work done by a small, nimble group that traveled light, slept in tents, and didn't stay in one place for long. 
</p>
<p>Then the settlers came behind the pioneers and set up more permanent communities. Yes, next quarter's profits are important. Yes, there are business needs and customer requests that must be met on a short term basis. We need settlers to dig into the details and bring robust products to market now, establishing a concrete expression of what the pioneers discover. 
</p>
<p>But if we don't have the pioneers charging ahead, we won't move very far from where we are right now. We will find ourselves adrift, slowly leaking, taking on water, and forced to throw dead weight overboard. When we operate with a mindset of scarcity, it leads to a reality of scarcity. When we trim fat, dump dead weight, and play defense we limit our ability to explore new lands. 
</p>
<p>There is uncertainty in pioneering. You can't ask an explorer what they will find on the other side of the ocean. The sailor can only read the skies and the seas and set a course. In order to be pioneers, we have to stop thinking like settlers. We have to stop using the same tools and metrics used by settlers. We have to take a new approach.  It requires looking into the future and exploring different places where it might be beneficial to bring in settlers and dig in. We can't say for sure what we will find, but we can cast a vision, enliven the imagination, and embolden others to follow.
