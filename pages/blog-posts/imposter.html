    <h2 class="section-title">RUNNING FROM SUCCESS</h2>
    <p>I’m a UX design manager. I love my job and I think I’m pretty good at it… most of the time. 
    </p>
    <p>I also go through bouts of imposter syndrome. In fact, I came into this role because of imposter syndrome. I spent my career running from roles, worried that if I didn’t leave soon enough, everyone would see me for the fraud that I was. A decade ago, I came to IBM as a front-end developer on a design team with less training than I believed I should have; I didn’t even know what user experience design was until after I was hired. After a few raises, a promotion, and several very good end of year reviews, I panicked. I thought I couldn’t keep up appearances and I would be “found out”. During my time as developer I picked up the craft of UX design so I transitioned to a UX design role to broaden my skill set. I won some awards, got promoted, and had more good end of year reviews. But I knew it was all a lie! I had to get out of the practitioner role before the mask came off and everyone would see how dumb I really was. So, I moved to management in an attempt to outrun imposter syndrome like it was the Grim Reaper.
    </p>
    <p>I don’t say this to toot my own horn, but to highlight how powerful of a force imposter syndrome can be. We’ve all read countless articles about imposter syndrome. We can all relate to the old Woody Allen quote.

    </div>
    <p>We know what it is even without reading about it. We live it every day. But is there a cure? While I sometimes still don’t feel like I have anything to offer, I will face my imposter syndrome and share a few coping mechanisms that have helped me not completely melt down in a pool of anxious sweat every day.
    </p>
    <h2 class="section-title">DUNNING-KRUGER MIND GAMES</h2>
    <p>First, I do want to review what imposter syndrome is, but only to make a point. Imposter syndrome is an unjustified sense of self-doubt - a personal belief that your true abilities are less than what other people perceive them to be. This key descriptor, “unjustified”,  is crucial. Working hard in order to do a good job despite your insecurities is not deceptive or fraudulent. It’s fueling the talent you have in order to produce high quality work. Imposter syndrome is telling yourself a lie about yourself. I understand this intellectually, but it doesn’t stop me from continuing to believe those lies. If you’re reading this, then I’m sure your experience is the same.

      </blockquote>
    </div>
    <p>Another tactic for overcoming imposter syndrome is to look at its root causes. To do that, let’s first look at the inverse of imposter syndrome, something called the <span class="blog-text-emphasis">Dunning-Kruger effect</span>; a bias where people with limited capacity overestimate their abilities. The less someone knows, the more they think they know. Ignorance is bliss, and apparently ignorance is also confidence. When you watch someone do something expertly that you have not done, your mind might tell you that what they are doing is easy because they make it look effortless, so your mind lies to you and tells you that you could also do that thing. You also might experience this if you are unaware of your incompetence to the point of not knowing what you don’t know. You are blind to your own inadequacies. 
    </p>
    <p>Back to imposter syndrome: As you work at a skillset, you grow in your knowledge of the details, depth, and complexity of that subject. You come to know what you don’t know more clearly over time. So while your abilities are increasing, your knowledge of the abilities you are yet to master also increases. The awareness of the gap between current ability and potential ability can lead to a feeling of inadequacy. When you compare what you know to what you don’t know about any subject, you will always feel inadequate, because very few skills can ever fully be mastered. There’s always more to learn.
    </p>
    <h2 class="section-title">COMPETENCE AND CONSCIOUSNESS</h2>
    <p>A simple tool I’ve learned to help understand this phenomenon of consciousness and competence is the learning square. Each side of the square represents a period of existing with a specific level of competence and consciousness of that competence. Each corner represents the hard work of moving to the next level of consciousness or competence. This is the process individuals go through on their way to mastery. (See Diagram 1)
    </p>

      </figure>
    </div>
    <p>At the beginning you don’t know what you don’t know. You have an <span class="blog-text-emphasis">unconscious incompetence</span>. You likely are experiencing the Dunning-Kruger effect where you are more confident in your abilities than you logically ought to be. Think of a kid sitting in the passenger seat of the car pretending to drive by turning their hands back and forth. Driving seems so simple. The kid might even play racing video games and think they can translate that to the real thing. This phase is necessary and good because it motivates someone to try something new, to take a risk because they don’t even think it’s a risk. If I was your teacher in this phase <span class="blog-text-emphasis">I do, and you watch</span>.
    </p>
    <p>However, you cannot learn something until you believe you need to learn. This is when you turn the corner to the phase of <span class="blog-text-emphasis">conscious incompetence</span> where you know what you don’t know. To learn and grow you must get to this point. You must face your inadequacies and acknowledge them. It is not easy and it is not fun. It can be humiliating and demoralizing. But it is necessary. For those that suffer most severely from the Dunning-Kruger effect it might take failing spectacularly to come to a point of knowing what they don’t know. If this is you, you might need to fail to the point where your mind cannot lie to you about your abilities. A kid who wants to learn to drive will need to sit in a car and try to drive before really understanding that they don’t know how to drive. For some this might even mean crashing the car. But that failure can be a good thing if it leads to a state of conscious incompetence and a willingness to learn.  If I was your teacher in this stage, <span class="blog-text-emphasis">I do and you help</span>. 
    </p>
    <p>Then comes the long hard work of learning. This leads to a state of <span class="blog-text-emphasis">conscious competence</span>. You now know what you know. It’s a very explicit kind of knowing. You know how to execute, but it isn’t easy or complete; there’s effort in every action. You think back to the lessons and pay attention to the execution. This is the new driver with hands on ten and two, checking every mirror twice before starting the car, reminding themself to buckle their seatbelt. They break early and accelerate slowly. Everything is intentional and conscious. This is a student driver where the instructor has an extra break pedal on the floor of the passenger side. If I was your teacher in this stage, <span class="blog-text-emphasis">you do and I help</span>.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, after what Malcolm Gladwell quantifies as 10,000 hrs of practice, you begin to experience <span class="blog-text-emphasis">unconscious competence</span>. You don’t know what you know. As a driver, this is when you drive home from work, but are so preoccupied with what’s on your mind, you don’t even remember the drive. It’s second nature. You take your knowledge for granted and assume that this level of ability is a given. Welcome to the depths of imposter syndrome. When you get to this stage, the chance of doubting yourself increases even more because you no longer think about what you can do. You just do it and you are looking ahead at the other things you haven’t mastered yet, because the square can start over on another skill or ability related to a particular skillset. You start to see that you’ve been in the unconscious incompetence phase for that next ability the whole time. At this stage, if I was your teacher, <span class="blog-text-emphasis">you do and I watch</span>. But when I watch and give feedback at this point, I can help alleviate imposter syndrome by reminding you of how far you’ve come. I can point out what you are doing well.
    </p>
    <p>Having people you trust to tell you the truth about your abilities is important, but it’s not the most effective way of overcoming imposter syndrome. In fact, if you don’t trust the people giving you feedback or if they only tell you the things you are doing well, they might make your imposter syndrome worse. Find people who you trust to tell you the truth whether it’s good or bad. It seems counter intuitive, but critical feedback can help remedy imposter syndrome because you know you aren’t tricking that person into thinking you know more than you do. They see your growth edges and name them. So when they give positive feedback, you can trust that also.
    </p>
    <h2 class="section-title">BECOME THE TEACHER</h2>
    <p>One of the best ways the learning square can help you overcome imposter syndrome is to step into the role of the teacher, mentor, or coach. Once you get to the fourth side, walk someone else through the square. This does a couple things for you. First, it forces you to back up from unconscious competence to a state of conscious competence because you have to be able to model or explain how to do a particular skill. If you ask Michael Jordan how to dribble, he might not be able to tell you right away. He just does it. It’s like breathing to him. He would have to back himself up to conscious competence in order to explain it in a way that’s helpful to you. When you move back up to conscious competence to guide someone else, you regain appreciation for the work it took to master that skill. The next benefit of leading someone else through the learning square is that it gives you a contrast of your abilities to their abilities. Seeing others struggle through the two conscious phases allows you to remember your journey and see how far you’ve come. Comparing your current abilities to where you used to be is much healthier than comparing your current abilities to some imaginary future state of mastery that is impossible to attain.
    </p>
    <p>Awareness of the learning square itself can help combat imposter syndrome. Being aware of where you are on the square with regards to a particular skill that’s triggering your imposter syndrome will remind you that it’s a process and either encourage you to keep growing until you reach mastery or reflect and appreciate how far you’ve come. It’s important to keep a record of achievements and recognitions, but like positive feedback, these can feed the doubt that you’ve tricked others. Therefore, alongside your record of strengths, it’s beneficial to keep a list of areas of growth.
    </p>
    <p>At IBM we talk about the T-shape. Where you have a depth of competencies in one domain, but also recognize where you have some abilities in other areas. Along with these lists of abilities should be a list of abilities you want to have but do not yet have. If you make a new T-shape chart on an annual basis, you can see it growing over time. You can also see in a comparable way the amount of skills you have in your core competency area versus other areas. This can help give perspective where you see that you are actually really proficient in your primary area as compared to other disciplines. The learning square can help when you are about to enter the cycle again with a new skill related to the larger skillset. Once you’ve cycled through the square a few times, each phase becomes more familiar. You can trust that although you’re currently facing conscious incompetence in a new area, you will improve and master it with time, determination, and support. The learning square with the T-shape chart is a powerful combination for simultaneously overcoming imposter syndrome while continuing to improve your abilities and skills.

      <blockquote>Instead of saying to yourself, “I can’t do this,” tell yourself, “I can’t do this, yet.”</blockquote>
    </div>

    <p>Another method I’ve found to help counteract imposter syndrome is to adopt a growth mindset. Instead of saying to yourself, “I can’t do this,” tell yourself, “I can’t do this, yet.” It’s that little word “yet” that makes the difference here. The perspective that the learning square and T-shape can give you allows you to adopt a more robust growth mindset where you recognize that abilities come with time and effort. But if you stick to it, you will probably be able to achieve your goals at some point. The long hard road through conscious incompetence and conscious competence can be energized by the word “yet”. “I can’t do this yet.” “I haven’t mastered this yet.”
    </p>
    <p>John Wesley, the founder of Methodism faced a lot of hardships and failures in his life. He sailed from England to America to preach but failed miserably and sailed home disgraced and deflated. He had lost his faith and didn’t know how to go on preaching. His friend Peter Bohler told him, “Preach faith till you have it and then because you have it, you will preach faith.”

      <blockquote>Essentially, the lesson is act with confidence until mastery arrives. </blockquote>
    </div>
    <p>As you learn and grow, you won’t be the master of most things right away but practice your skills with the confidence of someone who has mastered it, and over time that mastery will come, but in the meantime acting with confidence will give you the confidence you need to believe in yourself.
    </p>
    <p>I'd like to tell you that I've mastered my imposter syndrome, but I haven't. It still creeps in from time to time. But it happens less often and less intensely than it once did. I've come to a place where I'm getting more comfortable claiming what I do know and admitting what I don't know (both useful in fighting back against the doubt). I have the stability of being at the same company for almost six years, so I can reflect on how far I've come and take that along with all the positive feedback I've received and documented over the years and trust that the evidence that says I belong here outweighs the inner voice saying that I don't. But the thing that's helped me the most is knowing I'm not alone. As a manager, I get to hear about other people's struggles with imposter syndrome. I can see their brilliance and talents so clearly so when they say they feel inadequate I can remind myself that others might see me the same way I see them. As a leader, sharing my own struggles with imposter syndrome reinforces trust on my teams, strengthens my own growth in this area, and empowers my team to share their journeys and growth.
