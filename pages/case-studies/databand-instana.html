    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <div class="two-col-grid">
      <div class="one-of-two-col">
        <p>My team was tasked with running exploratory research to uncover connections between two IBM products, Databand and Instana, to identify and validate cross product solutions and integrations for a larger observability story.</p>
        <p>Automation executives need a way to quickly understand if there are viable use cases for how data engineers and devops engineers overlap and work together and understand how these two products could best work together to serve the observability market before staffing a full product and engineering team.</p>

    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p class="hero-sub">Timeline summary</p>
    <h2 class="section-title">SCOPE WORK AND DEVELOP PLAN</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop research plan breaking into 2 studies</li>
      <li>Create screener for Data Engineers and DevOps</li>
      <li>Interview 16 participants to understand their roles</li>
      <li>Synthesise 2 studies and then compare to find potential overlap between Data engineers and DevOps</li>
      <li>Define use cases and pain points</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="section-title">CREATE MULTIPLE POTENTIAL INTEGRATION PROPOSALS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop big ideas that correspond with pain points for each need statement</li>
      <li>Build midfi screens to show potential user flows showing optimal ways Databand and Instana can work together with a range of integration</li>
      <li>Meet with product management and lead developers for both products to discuss feasibility and refine concepts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="section-title">TEST CONCEPTS WITH USERS AND MARKET</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Set up interviews with potential users, analysts, and sales</li>
      <li>Create mural flow to walk through 7 potential concepts</li>
      <li>Have participants rank concepts</li>
      <li>Synthesise results for final proposal</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="section-title">FINAL PLAYBACK WITH PROPOSAL</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Playback high level breakdown of work and then propose next steps for moving forward</li>
      <li>Meet with product management and lead developers for both product teams to discuss concepts and open door for deeper discussion.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="hero-sub">Details of generative research</p>
    <P>For this effort we conducted interviews with two different user groups at the same time, using a set of similar questions. The goal was to compare perspectives and use cases that bridged across both the data engineer and devOps perspectives. We interviewed 8 Data engineers and 9 DevOps engineers.</P>

    <h2 class="section-title">UNDERSTAND DATA ENGINEER AND DEVOPS RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>
    <p>Identify where both roles collaborate and if there are opportunities for creating better visibility between roles to help outline 2-3 common use cases with pain points and opportunities to improve how they work today</p>
    <h2 class="section-title">HAVE PARTICIPANTS DEFINE WHAT OBSERVABILITY MEANS TO THEIR ROLE</h2>
    <p>Discovery how data engineers and devops define observability as it relates to their role to see if there is overlap in terminology between roles</p>
    <h2 class="section-title">MAP RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TEAM STRUCTURE AND COMMON TOOLS</h2>
    <p>Find any overlaps in tools used by data engineers and devops and understand team structure to see collaboration points</p>
