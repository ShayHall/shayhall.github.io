        <p>Design and product management executives need a way to explore forward thinking opportunities so they don't waste unnecessary time and resources, but most design teams do not have the skills, structure, or bandwidth to explore and incubate future opportunities.</p>
        <p>The Jumpstart Innovation team creates "UX concept cars" that distill multiple innovative ideas into broad designs to guide future versions of IBM Automation products into more competitive and strategic directions by utilizing a multi-disciplinary design team with required bandwidth, experience, and structure that traditional product teams do not have.</p>
